\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

An upper bound nucleus size of 5.7 km for comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-Atlas) places it within typical ranges observed for
long-period comets and agrees with other estimates for A3 \citep{Meech2004, Liu2025}.

We did not detect any molecular spectral lines for methanol or sulfur monoxide. Both \cite{Tang2024} and \cite{Cambianica2025} measured a depleted comet. \cite{Cambianica2025} were able to detect CN molecular lines in the visual spectrum using the DOLORES spectrograph and derive a production rate, but they detected no other species. They also measured a large dust opacity, in line with observations by Tang et al., and also in line with our calculations of a rather massive dust coma, which may serve to obscure any molecular lines in the visible spectrum. Also, our detection of the comet continuum was only to \(6\sigma\) confidence compared to \textgreater\(10\sigma\) for \cite{Lellouch2022}.
